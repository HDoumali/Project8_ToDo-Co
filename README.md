### Monitoring the qualité and performance of the application 

# Quality 

To ensure the quality of our application, we used the Codacy tool that allows us to review our code and monitor the quality of it

# Performance

In order to analyze the performance of the ToDoList application, we use the Blackfire tool that allows an analysis in the details of the application's performance.

# Test 

We used PHPUnit to perform the unit and functional tests of the application.
